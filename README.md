# Vector-Private-Online-Operating-System
Concept design of an Online Operating system with custom cursors and custom Icon setups. Imagine having an online operating system that works solely on the Internet, all the apps that you wanna work on at one place freeing space for your HDD with the files being installed at online Storage. For now just an idea, but in the future might become a reality, who knows. :)
